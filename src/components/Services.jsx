          <p>Your services page is one of the most critical pages on your website whose
            purpose is to not only reveal what you offer but how your company stands out
            from the rest.
          </p>
          <p>Based upon the service you have; you need to figure out the best way to
            explain it. This could be through short sentences, long paragraphs, bullet
            point sections, or video.</p>
          <p>While you may have a killer services page at the end of this, you then
            have your competitors to worry about. How can you distinguish yourself from
            them and prove you provide the better solution?</p>

          <p>When describing the services you offer, it’s very easy to get caught up in the ‘we’. But why wouldn’t you? The
            services page is about what ‘we’ (your company) can do, and how great you are at
            it.</p>
          <p>I challenge you to take the approach that Medallia did with there
            services page. Although they make sure to mention how their services will
            turn into the solutions for their audience, they make sure to include the
            reader (or the potential customer) is involved within each of the services.
          </p>
          <p>Their content is written to make it apparent that the services are not
            one sided. Medallia intends to work with its customer as if the two are on
            a team (as all client-customer relationships should be).</p>
